  "body": "### Astronomy 250: Stellar Populations, Fall 2016\r\n\r\n**Class Description:**\r\n\r\nThis class is a survey of contemporary extragalactic stellar populations. We will cover such topics as the IMF, ages of stars and galaxies, dust, modeling resolved and unresolved stellar systems, and interpreting observations of galaxies at various redshifts. This class involves reading and discussion of key current and historical papers, and gaining an appreciation for challenges in the field through select coding exercises and problem sets.\r\n\r\n**Instructor:** [Dan Weisz](http://dweisz.github.io), Professor of [Astronomy](www.astro.berkeley.edu)\r\n\r\n**Time and Place:** Monday and Wednesday, 10-11:30am in 501b Campbell.\r\n\r\n**Office Hours:** Campbell 311. Wednesdays 1:30-2:30pm, by appointment ([email me](mailto:dan.weisz@berkeley.edu)), or anytime I'm in my office and not with anyone else.\r\n\r\n**Class Goals:**  \r\n\r\n1.  An understanding of stellar populations and how we know ages, metallicities, dust content, etc. for stellar systems (mainly galaxies) in the local and distant Universe.\r\n2.  A basic working knowledge of fitting models to data in a probabilistic framework.\r\n3.  An increased comfort level with working in an open-source environment.\r\n\r\n**Format:** Very informal -- Mostly discussion of readings, coding as problem sets, and some lecture.\r\n\r\n**Requirements:** \r\n\r\n1. Complete assigned readings\r\n2. Active participation in discussion of papers, including leading of discussion.\r\n3. Make a reasonable attempt at completing the problem sets.\r\n4. *Maybe* pushing a unit test to python FSPS as a final project.\r\n\r\nThis course requires the use of python and github for problem sets.  More details at the bottom.\r\n\r\n#### Course Outline and Topics:\r\n\r\n* Intro to Probability, Statistics, and Modeling data (~2 weeks)\r\n* Stellar Initial Mass Function (~2 weeks)\r\n* Resolved Stellar Populations and Stellar Models (~3-4 weeks)\r\n* Dust (~2 weeks)\r\n* Unresolved galaxies near and far (~2 weeks)\r\n* high-z Universe (~2 weeks)\r\n\r\n#### Schedule and Assignments:\r\n\r\n**0. Intro to Stellar Populations (Weds 8/24)**\r\n * Assignment due by 8/29: Create a github repo and email me your username.

Each student will need their own github account and a public repository specifically for this class.  Problem sets should all be done in your own public repository. For those new to github, it has a gentle learning curve and most questions can be addressed simply with [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and/or via Google.  \r\n\r\nProblem sets involving coding should be done using python and juypter (formerly iPython notebook). Any flavor of python is fine, although the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io) is highly recommended. University affiliates can get it for [free](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-academic-subscriptions-available).\r\n\r\n[juypter](http://jupyter.org) is an excellent web-based coding/python notebook that allows you to easily track and transparently share your code, as well as display key plots inline.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard python installation, we will also use these python packages:\r\n\r\n* [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current)\r\n* [fsps](https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps)\r\n* [python-fsps](http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/)\r\n* [prospector](https://github.com/bd-j/prospector)\r\n\r\nfsps and python-fsps can, at times, be tricky to install. Give yourself plenty of time to install and troubleshoot before we need to use them in class.",
