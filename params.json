  "body": "### Astronomy 250: Stellar Populations, Fall 2016\r\n\r\n**Class Description:**\r\n\r\nThis class is a survey of contemporary extragalactic stellar populations. It involves reading and discussion of key papers, as well as addressing basic problems in the field through coding exercises. We will explore such topics as the IMF, ages of stars and galaxies, dust, modeling resolved and unresolved stellar systems, and interpreting observations of galaxies at various redshifts.\r\n\r\n**Instructor:** [Dan Weisz](http://dweisz.github.io), Professor of [Astronomy](www.astro.berkeley.edu)\r\n\r\n**Time and Place:** Mondays and Wednesdays 10-11:30am in 501b Campbell. Note that I will likely be out of town for a few scheduled meetings. We will discuss the possibility of rescheduling these dates.\r\n\r\n**Office Hours:** Campbell 311. Wednesdays 1:30-2:30pm, by appointment ([email me](mailto:dan.weisz@berkeley.edu)), or anytime I'm in my office and not with anyone else.\r\n\r\n**Class Goals:**  \r\n\r\n1.  An increased understanding of stellar populations and how we know ages, metallicities, dust content, etc. for stellar systems (mainly galaxies) in the local and distant Universe.\r\n2.  A basic working knowledge of fitting models to data in a probabilistic framework.\r\n3.  Increasing your comfort level with work in an open-source environment.\r\n\r\n**Format:** Very informal -- Mostly discussion of readings, coding as problem sets, and some lecture.\r\n\r\n**Requirements:** Complete weekly readings and be ready to actively discuss or lead discussion. Make reasonable attempts at complete the problem sets.  There may also be student led presentations and/or a unit test push to python FSPS.\r\n\r\nThis course requires the use of python and github for problem sets.  Details at the bottom.\r\n\r\n#### Course Outline and Topics:\r\n\r\n* Intro to Probability, Statistics, and Modeling data (~2 weeks)\r\n* Stellar Initial Mass Function (~2 weeks)\r\n* Resolved Stellar Populations and Stellar Models (~3-4 weeks)\r\n* Dust (~2 weeks)\r\n* Unresolved galaxies near and far (~2 weeks)\r\n* high-z Universe (~2 weeks)\r\n\r\n#### Reading assignments:\r\n\r\n1. Probability, Statistics, and Modeling\r\nBrewer, Hogg, Foreman Mackey\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Problem Sets\r\n\r\nRoughly 1 problem set every 2 weeks.  Problem sets should be completed publicly via github (see below) and group work on the problem sets is encouraged.  However, everyone must write their own code (i.e., no direct copying)\r\n\r\n1.  Basic Probability and Modeling Fitting (Assigned 8/29, due 9/12)\r\n2.  IMF (Assigned 9/12, Due 9/26)\r\n3. XXX\r\n4. XXX\r\n5. XXX\r\n6. XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Software\r\n\r\nProblem sets require the use of github.  Each student will need their own public github account and a repository specifically for this class.  Problem sets should all be done in your own public repository. For those new to github, it has a gentle learning curve and most questions can be addressed simply with [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and/or via Google.  \r\n\r\nProblem sets involving coding should be done using python and juypter (formerly iPython notebook). Any flavor of python is fine, although the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io) is highly recommended. University affiliates can get it for [free](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-academic-subscriptions-available).\r\n\r\n[juypter](http://jupyter.org) is an excellent web-based coding/python notebook that allows you to easily track and transparently share your code, as well as display key plots inline.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard python installation, we will also use these python packages, and thus you should install them:\r\n\r\n* [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current)\r\n* [fsps](https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps)\r\n* [python-fsps](http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/)\r\n\r\nfsps and python-fsps can, at times, be tricky to install. Give yourself plenty of time to install and troubleshoot before we need to use them in class.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
