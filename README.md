Astro 250 -- Extra Galactic Stellar Populations


#### GitHub

This class will make heavy use of GitHub. Notes, homework sets, data, slides, etc. will all be posted through the classes main GitHub repo and you should "fork" the repository so you can develop, do the homework, etc. on your own. Similarly, we will use the GitHub framework for addressing questions.  When you have questions about an assignment, notes, etc. you should raise an "issue".  

All of your work will be visible to each other and anyone that wants to look at your repo.  You should become comfortable with the idea of doing your work in the open -- transparency is fundamental to science.

For those not familiar with GitHub, there are number of tutorials on the web for how it works. Here are a few examples to get you started: 

* [GitHub Tutorial 1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&ved=0ahUKEwixhIDl-ujMAhUPwGMKHRicD-sQFghJMAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fblog%2Fsoftware-development%2Fgithub-tutorial&usg=AFQjCNEUOEcsbwlha9HaaWRPMREw7ZR3kw&sig2=cCgEtsK5eVAGb1Ti3mmd8w)

* [GitHub Tutorial 2](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

* [GitHub Tutorial 3](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

There are also several useful GitHub cheat sheets, such as this [one](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png).


#### Python

All coding exercises in this class should be done in python. For those less familiar with python, I provide a few links to tutorials below.  There are many, many web resources for learning python.

For simplicity and future code compabtility reasons, I suggest using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python.  You can obtain a free academic version [here](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-academic-subscriptions-available).  You can certainly use other distributions, but I have had the least hassle with Conda.

Python 2.7 is the "safe" version of Python, although much development is now being done in Python 3.x (the latest version is 3.5).  You can easily install both, if you wish.  Unfortunately, not all Python code is compabtile with both Python 2.x and 3.x. We'll try to minimize compabiltity issues, but they are unavoidable. Expect a few throughout the course of the semester.
