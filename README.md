Astro 250 -- Extra Galactic Stellar Populations


#### GitHub

This class will make heavy use of GitHub. Notes, homework sets, data, slides, etc. will all be posted through the classes main GitHub repo and you should fork the repository so you can develop, do the homework, etc. on your own. Similarly, we will use the GitHub framework for addressing questions.  When you have questions about an assignment, notes, etc. you should raise an "issue".  

All of your work will be visible to each other and anyone that wants to look at your repo.  You should become comfortable with the idea of doing your work in the open -- transparency is fundamental to science.

For those not familiar with GitHub, there are number of tutorials on the web for how it works. Here are a few examples to get you started:
